<p>The goal of this assignment is to get to implement 2D rasterization algorithms for lines and polygons. Specifically, you will be asked to implement the Midpoint Line Drawing Algorithm and the parallel triangle fill algorithm as discussed in class.</p>
<h2>What you need to do</h2>
<ul>
<li>Start editing the assignment template which can be found at: <a href="https://editor.p5js.org/RBailey/sketches/zW_0LRpmT">https://editor.p5js.org/RBailey/sketches/zW_0LRpmT</a>. Once the template appears in the p5.org editor, use the File-&gt;Duplicate menu item to duplicate the template.&nbsp; (You will not be able to save any edits until you Duplicate, please be sure that you are logged into your account on p5js.org).<br><br></li>
<li>Once you are working on the duplicate file, you can edit the file in the browser editor.&nbsp; You job is to:<br><br>
<ul>
<li>Implement the Midpoint line drawing Algorithm by filling in code for the&nbsp;drawLine(x1, y1, x2, y2, r, g, b)&nbsp;function.<br><br></li>
<li>Implement the parallel triangle fill Algorithm by filling in code for the&nbsp;drawTriangle(p1x, p1y, p2x, p2y, p3x, p3y, r, g, b)&nbsp;function.<br><br></li>
<li>For both functions, you will need to use the&nbsp;setPixel(x, y, r, g, b)&nbsp;function which is supplied, that will set a pixel to a given (r,g,b) value.<br><br></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>You are welcome to include new auxiliary functions that your algorithms can call, but please do not edit any of the template code below the line indicated.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>When you run the sketch, you can press "l" to toggle between the line screen and the triangle screen.&nbsp; Also, for both screens, hitting the "p" key will toggle between your solution and the Processing solution. &nbsp;Please keep in mind that the comparison with p5.org is for reference only as we do not know the exact algorithm used by Processing to draw in lines and triangles. so your solution may be a little bit different than the reference solution.&nbsp; Differences, however, should be minor.<br><br></li>
<li>Below are screenshots of the correct output (your solution is rendered in yellow):</li>

<p></p>
<ul>
<li>When you are happy with your drawing, please use the File-&gt;Share menu item and get a link for a Fullscreen version of the finished sketch.&nbsp; Copy this link and submit the link to the&nbsp; Dropbox labeled <a href="/d2l/common/dialogs/quickLink/quickLink.d2l?ou=1067514&amp;type=dropbox&amp;rcode=rochester-9208695" target="_self">Assignment 4 - Rasterization</a>.<br><br></li>
<li>Submit the link to the Fullscreen version in the comment section and provide the screenshot of your final output in a pdf file in the dropbox. No need to add your code in pdf file, just the output.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<h2>Due Date</h2>
<p>This assignment is due by end of day Tuesday, February 27.&nbsp;</p></body></html>
